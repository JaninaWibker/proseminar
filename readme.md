# Slides

Uses [marp](https://marp.app) for slides along with a few markdown-it plugins and a custom theme.

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io) was chosen as the package manager, but npm works as a drop-in replacement.

Start by installing dependencies: `pnpm install`

To preview slides in the browser use `pnpm dev`.

To build slides use `pnpm build`.
